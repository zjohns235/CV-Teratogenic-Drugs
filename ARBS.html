  <p><span class="pregnancy-summary">Pregnancy Summary:</span> The antihypertensive mechanisms of action of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBS) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are very close. That is, the former selectively blocks the binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, whereas the latter prevents the formation of angiotensin II itself. Therefore, use of this drug during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters may cause teratogenicity and severe fetal and neonatal toxicity that is identical to that seen with ACE inhibitors. </p>
  <p><span class="breastfeeding-summary">Breast-feeding Summary:</span> No reports describing the use of ARB's during human lactation have been located. The effects of this exposure on a nursing infant are unknown</p>
