  <h1>Statins</h1>
  <h2>(Atorvastatin, Fluvastatin, Lovastatin, Pitavastatin, Pravastatin, Rosuvastatin, Simvastatin)</h2>
  <p><span class="pregnancy-recommendation">Pregnancy Recommendation:</span> Contraindicated 1st trimester.</p>
  <p><span class="breastfeeding-recommendation">Breast-feeding Recommendation:</span> Contraindicated</p>
  <p><span class="pregnancy-summary">Pregnancy Summary:</span> The interruption of cholesterol-lowering therapy during pregnancy should have no effect on long-term treatment of hyperlipidemia. Cholesterol and products synthesized by cholesterol are important during fetal development. Moreover, maternal cholesterol levels increase during pregnancy. Because of a potential for embryo–fetal risk, the use of statins should be classified as contraindicated in the 1st trimester. However, the absolute embryo–fetal risk from inadvertent exposure during this period appears to be low. The lipophilic statins in this subclass are atorvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin.</p>

<p><span class="breastfeeding-summary">Breast-feeding Summary:</span> No reports describing the use of atorvastatin in human lactation have been located. The relatively high molecular weight (about 1161 for the nonhydrated form) suggests that excretion into milk should be low if it occurs at all, but some excretion should be expected. Because of the potential for adverse effects in a nursing infant, women who are taking atorvastatin should not breastfeed. The most common (≥2%) adverse effects in nonpregnant patients were nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, diarrhea, pain in the extremity, and urinary tract infections. If a mother is taking this drug and decides to breastfeed, her nursing infant should be monitored for these effects.</p>
