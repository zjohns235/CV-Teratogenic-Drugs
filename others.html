  <h1>Other Potential Cardiovascular Teratogenic Medications</h1>
  <h2>Atenolol</h2>
  <p><span class="pregnancy-recommendation">Pregnancy Recommendation:</span> Human Data Suggest Risk in 2nd and 3rd Trimesters</p>
  <p><span class="breastfeeding-recommendation">Breast-feeding Recommendation:</span> Limited Human Data—Potential Toxicity</p>
  <p><span class="pregnancy-summary">Pregnancy Summary:</span> Atenolol may cause growth restriction and reduced placental weight. The drug does not possess intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) (i.e., partial agonist). The reduced fetal growth appears to be related to increased vascular resistance in both the mother and fetus and is a function of the length of drug exposure. Treatment starting early in the 2nd trimester is associated with the greatest decrease in fetal and placental weights, whereas treatment restricted to the 3rd trimester primarily affects only placental weight. Although growth restriction is a serious concern, the benefits of maternal therapy with β-blockers, in some cases, might outweigh the risks to the fetus and must be judged on a case-by-case basis. Because only one case has been reported, an association between atenolol and fetal retroperitoneal fibromatosis requires confirmation. Newborns exposed to atenolol near delivery should be closely observed during the first 24–48 hours for signs and symptoms of β-blockade. The long-term effects of prolonged in utero exposure to this class of drugs have not been studied but warrant evaluation.</p>
  <p><span class="breastfeeding-summary">Breast-feeding Summary:</span> Adverse reactions in infants have not been reported. However, because milk accumulation occurs with atenolol, nursing infants must be closely monitored for bradycardia and other signs and symptoms of β-blockade.</p>
  <h3>Amiodarone</h3>
  <p><span class="pregnancy-recommendation">Pregnancy Recommendation:</span> Human and Animal Data Suggest Risk</p>
  <p><span class="breastfeeding-recommendation">Breast-feeding Recommendation:</span> Contraindicated</p>
  <p><span class="pregnancy-summary">Pregnancy Summary:</span> Fetal adverse effects directly attributable to amiodarone have been observed. Congenital goiter/hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism may occur after in utero exposure. Newborns exposed to amiodarone in utero should have thyroid function studies performed because of the large proportion of iodine contained in each dose.</p>
  <p><span class="breastfeeding-summary">Breast-feeding Summary:</span> Amiodarone is excreted into breast milk. Although no adverse effects were observed in one breastfed infant, relatively large amounts of the drug and its metabolite are available through the milk. In 2001, the American Academy of Pediatrics, noting that hypothyroidism is a potential complication, classified amiodarone as a drug for which the effect on nursing infants is unknown but may be of concern </p>
