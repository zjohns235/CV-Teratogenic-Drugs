  <p><span class="pregnancy-summary">Pregnancy Summary:</span> The use of coumarin derivatives during the 1st trimester carries with it a significant risk to the fetus. For all cases, only about 70% of pregnancies are expected to result in a normal infant. Exposure in the 6thâ€“9th weeks of gestation may produce a pattern of defects termed the fetal warfarin syndrome with an incidence up to 25% or greater in some series. Infants exposed before and after this period have had other congenital anomalies, but the relationship between warfarin and these defects is unknown. Infrequent central nervous system defects, which have greater clinical significance to the infant than the defects of the fetal warfarin syndrome, may be deformations related to hemorrhage and scarring with subsequent impaired growth of brain tissue. Spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths may also occur. If the mother's condition requires anticoagulation, the use of heparin from the start of the 6th gestational week through the end of the 12th gestational week, and again at term, may lessen the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome.</p>
  <p><span class="breastfeeding-summary">Breast-feeding Summary:</span> Maternal warfarin consumption apparently does not pose a significant risk to normal, full-term, breastfed infants. Other oral anticoagulants should be avoided by the lactating woman.</p>
